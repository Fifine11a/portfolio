      <h1>Marie Mare코ov치</h1>
      <p>
        After 10 years in Logistics & Distribution, Warehouse and Sales
        operations I discovered my true love is programming and since 2019,
        completed classes and continue to educate myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I experienced the E2E Supply Chain from a buyer position all the way to
        claims and returns. From daily operations to managing distribution to
        almost all of Western Europe. And now I am determined to become a
        front-end developer. After an intensive 3 months (300h) course, focused
        mainly on JavaScript and React, I feel ready to start my new career.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this website in January 2021 in order to showcase the level of
        my coding skills. It is a simple pure CSS, I tried to keep it rather
        minimalistic. There are only school projects so far. I separated SwapApp
        - the final project - as it is a much more complex code which was
        completely built by my study partner and me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I may not be the most experienced front-end developer just yet, but I am
        driven and passionate about programming. I am a fast learner, a team
        player, I am optimistic, enthusiastic, and dynamic. I can also offer
        skills, developed during my previous career - out of the box thinking,
        problem solving, patience and flexibility.
